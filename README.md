This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# TODO Liste
I created this project for training on TypeScript and learning the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) library

This library provides a bunch of React components ready to use and designed the Material way.

## DEMO
1. Clone this repo anywhere
2. Run `npm i` (or `npm install` for purists =p)
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. You're done !

After running the last command, the dev-server will start and then open http://localhost:3000 page on your browser automatically

## PRODUCTION
1. Clone this repo anywhere
2. Run `npm i` (or `npm install` for purists =p)
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Run `npm start`
5. You're done !

After running the last command, `serve` will host the app and this last one will be available at http://localhost:7080

- This port can be changed in the `package.json` file in the `start` script.
- You can use any web-server you want/need. After all, this app is client-side only so you can serve it like you want.

For production purposes with NodeJS, you can proxy the app available on port 7080 with NGINX for example.
